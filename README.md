AI Accent Classifier
A Streamlit-powered web application for classifying English accents using machine learning and audio signal processing. The app extracts robust speech features from uploaded audio files and predicts the speaker's accent among ten regional varieties, including American, British, Indian, and more.

Built with librosa, scikit-learn, and RandomForestClassifier, the model uses a balanced training set and includes bias diagnostics and interpretability tools such as entropy analysis and prediction visualization.
